I plan to develop and support several extensions, all of which will remain open source and available for free via repositories within this account. Additionally, I may use some of these pages to document my experiences with M2.\r\n\r\n### Web Development\r\nWith nearly 5 years of web development experience under my belt, I'm starting to come into my own not only as a dev, but as a leader within development teams and agencies. I will be documenting processes and workflows that have increased my own efficiency with the hope that it helps someone else down the road. Efficient web development practices is one of the topics that I'm most passionate about and one that affects anyone in the web dev industry most directly.\r\n\r\n### Deep / Machine Learning\r\nAs a total n00b when it comes to deep learning, I'll be starting projects, documenting my workflows and hopefully building some really cool stuff.\r\n\r\n### Misc Dev\r\nI've been playing around with some Wordpress and Laravel projects that will also have related content published here. Mostly just random things that I think are interesting. We shall see...\r\n",
