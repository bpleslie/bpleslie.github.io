The idea for this site originated when I discovered the flexibility of <a href="https://pages.github.com/"
title="GitHub Pages" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> while researching some deep learning topics . After playing around
with their page generation tool for a bit, I decided to check out their other option for building out Pages: a ruby-based
blog (with no database), called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>

Although I never used it before, Jekyll ended up being a pretty clean and efficient solution. A blog with no database
is a fairly revolutionary concept for me. So far, my impression is that this is a cross between an ultra basic template
like Bootstrap's boilerplate and something more powerful like Wordpress. This is about as deep as I've gotten with ruby
and Jekyll, but I'm looking forward to continuing the journey.
