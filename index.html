<a id="welcome-to-my-github-page" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-github-page" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my GitHub page</h3>

<p>This account holds all of my personal projects and resources, including Magento modules, Ubuntu setup guides, deep / machine learning projects, etc. Feel free to contribute and / or reach out to me regarding anything you find interesting.</p>

<h3>
<a id="magento" class="anchor" href="#magento" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Magento</h3>

<p>I've been working with Magento for 2.5 years at this point and am starting to get more serious about Magento 2. I plan to develop and support several extensions, all of which will remain open source and available for free via repositories within this account. Additionally, I may use some of these pages to document my experiences with M2.</p>

<h3>
<a id="web-development" class="anchor" href="#web-development" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Web Development</h3>

<p>With nearly 5 years of web development experience under my belt, I'm starting to come into my own not only as a dev, but as a leader within development teams and agencies. I will be documenting processes and workflows that have increased my own efficiency with the hope that it helps someone else down the road. Efficient web development practices is one of the topics that I'm most passionate about and one that affects anyone in the web dev industry most directly.</p>

<h3>
<a id="deep--machine-learning" class="anchor" href="#deep--machine-learning" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deep / Machine Learning</h3>

<p>As a total n00b when it comes to deep learning, I'll be starting projects, documenting my workflows and hopefully building some really cool stuff.</p>

<h3>
<a id="misc-dev" class="anchor" href="#misc-dev" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Misc Dev</h3>

<p>I've been playing around with some Wordpress and Laravel projects that will also have related content published here. Mostly just random things that I think are interesting. We shall see...</p>
